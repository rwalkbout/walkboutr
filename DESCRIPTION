Description: Generates walk bouts from GPS and accelerometry data. 
    A walk bout is a period of activity with accelerometer movement matching the 
    patterns of walking with corresponding GPS measurements that confirm travel. 
    The inputs of the walkboutr package are individual-level accelerometry and GPS 
    data. The outputs of the model are walk bouts with corresponding times, 
    duration, and summary statistics on the sample population, which collapse all 
    personally identifying information. These bouts can be used to measure walking 
    both as an outcome of a change to the built environment or as a predictor of 
    health outcomes such as a cardioprotective behavior.
